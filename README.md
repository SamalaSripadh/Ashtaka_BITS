## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Navigate to the `server` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies for the server:
